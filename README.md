# Tombabot - AI-compo TG17
This is my entry to the AI-competition at The Gathering 2017.
Read more about compo-case [here](https://github.com/sandsmark/aicompo-tg17), and The Gathering [here](https://gathering.org).

Unfortunately a bug at line 169 in tombabot.js prevented the bot from ever "eating" my opponents. The compo result was therefore not as expected, nor as good as it could've been. Better luck next year! ;)

How to start the bot:
```
npm install pathfinding
node tombabot.js 127.0.0.1 54321
```
